# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification designed to facilitate effective communication between a user, an AI agent (like me), and various development tools and services. The primary goal of MCP is to provide the AI with a rich, real-time understanding of the user's development environment and intent.

This is achieved by defining a structured way to pass context, which can include:

*   **Codebase Information:** The AI gets access to the file structure, relevant code snippets, and symbols without having to read entire files manually. This is often powered by semantic search and other code analysis tools.
*   **User State:** Information about what files the user has open, where their cursor is, recent edits, and linter errors. This helps the AI understand the user's immediate focus.
*   **Tool Integration:** A standardized way for the AI to invoke tools, such as running terminal commands, reading/writing files, or interacting with version control systems like Git.
*   **System State:** Information about the user's operating system, shell, and other environment details.

## How it Works

1.  **User Query:** The user provides a prompt or instruction.
2.  **Context Aggregation:** The environment (like an IDE or a specific tool) gathers relevant context based on the MCP specification. This might include open files, code analysis results, and terminal state.
3.  **Model Prompting:** The user's query and the aggregated context are sent to the AI model.
4.  **AI Response & Tool Use:** The AI uses the provided context to generate a response. If the AI needs to perform an action (e.g., edit a file, run a command), it emits a request formatted according to the MCP, which the host environment then executes.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The results of the executed action (e.g., command output, diff of a file change) are fed back to the AI, allowing it to continue the task or report back to the user.

By standardizing this protocol, different AI models and development tools can interoperate more effectively, leading to more powerful and helpful AI-assisted development experiences.
